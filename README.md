# Covid-19-analysis

## Introduction
This project combines big data techniques and cloud computing to analyze covid-19 cases data in Spain in short period of time.

Unlike other sites, this is not another covid portal that shows the number of cases. We focused in cleaning up data, grouping
it by CCAA (autonomous communities) and add up the numbers. After the processing is done we analyze the data and try to find correlations and show the results as a graph.

These correlations do not imply causation.
